J. Mark Bertrand, having just released ◊emph{◊amazon["B0054Z7L58"]{Pattern of Wounds}} , the second in a series of mystery novels, is giving away the Kindle edition of ◊emph{◊amazon["B008BTH59Q"]{Back on Murder}} (the first book in the series) for free for a limited time.

I have not read either yet, but I have downloaded the free ebook and will be reading it as soon as I can! I’m always on the lookout for new reading material and thought I’d pass this on.

J. Mark Bertrand is also known as the writer of ◊link["http://www.bibledesignblog.com/"]{Bible Design Blog}, which centers around reviews and features of very high-quality Bibles and book-making in general. It’s actually a rather interesting subject even if you are not religious. See his announcement about his novels ◊link["http://www.bibledesignblog.com/2011/07/new-book-release-free-kindle-download.html"]{here}.
